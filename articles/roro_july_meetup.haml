  Last night saw another great Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney July meetup (say _that_ ten times quickly). We were lucky to have "Brad":http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/users/37 at "Job Futures":http://jobfutures.com.au pitch in with supplying the venue yet again, as well as us scoring 4 great presenters and plenty of drinks:
  
   * <a href="#matt-allen">Matt Allen - Rails on the Fairway</a>
   * <a href="#lachlan-hardy">Lachlan Hardy - Beautiful Maintainable CSS</a>
   * <a href="#patrick-crowley">Patrick Crowley - Styler & Headliner</a>
   * <a href="#hoan-ton-that">Hoan Ton-That - facebook-rails</a>
  
  For those who weren't there we managed to record the video via VNC and screen cap, and the audio thanks to a last-minute purchase by "Jason Crane":http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/users/2. Though Lachlan's preso had problems with bandwith (note to self: VNC over wifi not good) it worked seamlessly, and I've sent the videos to Lachie via Auspostnet for further processing. The start of a podcast maybe? Who knows...
  
  "Marcus":http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/users/40 managed to pop his Melbourne head in for a few mintues over ichat but we couldn't keep it up unfortunately. Have to think more about the whole webcasting thang eh.
  
  h3(#matt-allen). Matt Allen - Rails on the Fairway
  
  "Matt Allen":http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/users/4 gave an intro to <a href="http://iseekgolf.com/">iseekgolf.com</a>'s history and scaling issues, giving a bit of a history behind how it went from a large PHP app with a phpBB forum with just under 300k posts, to a Rails application and Beast. It was interesting to see all the caching on the site is done with fragment caches on the file system, using observers and cron-jobs to have everything ticking over automatically.
  
  iseekgolf handles 200k req/s during peak on 4 mongrels for the Rails app and 4 mongrels for the beast forum, with a separate DB server.
  
  <strong class="update">Update:</strong> My very poor choice of wording below ("feature hungry whiners") in describing Matt's small aside about the change of forum software seems to have upset a lot of people. These were my words, not his. See my comments below for my take. 
  
  Matt also mentioned changing from phpBB to Beast weeded out all the feature-hungry whiners from the community who split off and created their own forum, leaving only the people with an interest in golf and helping the community in the iseekgolf forums. Possible community management stategy?
  
  h3(#lachlan-hardy). Lachlan Hardy - Beautiful Maintainable CSS
  
  "Lachlan":http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/users/13 receives the prize for the sexiest presentation of the evening. Though Lachlan is a front-end coder by day he comes with an appreciation for the Ruby aesthetic and design, showing us how to create logical, maintainable CSS just like we do with Ruby. He explained using CSS shorthand is like using <code>select</code> and <code>reject</code>
  to work with collections instead of an <code>each</code> loop with an <code>if</code> statement. Sure it requires you understand the syntax, but it's always better to master the language to create more concise and descriptive code.
  
  Some of his general tips:
  
  * A system or framework always trumps adhoc coding, so...
  * If you don't order your CSS property statements, then use the system of ordering them alphabetically.
  * Nesting can infer hierarchy. Use this to your advantage.
  * Large files need tables of content, just like large files of Ruby need structured navigation (though usually from the code itself).
  * Write semantic HTML (CSS was designed for it which will help write elegant code)
  
  h3(#patrick-crowley). Patrick Crowley - Styler & Headliner
  
  We're lucky enough to have "Patrick Crowley":http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/users/53 in town from the "San Diego Ruby Brigade":http://sdruby.com/, the master of Ruby Brigade video podcasts, who is staying in Sydney the two months the rest of Sydney is running to far-north Queensland to escape the cold. 
  
  Patrick demo'd two plugins which solve problems that he's come across in almost every Rails app he's developed; managing and organising your CSS files, and doing page titles.
  
  The first plugin he demo'd, Styler, automagically causes a request for @/articles/1/edit@ to turn:
  
  <pre><code><%= stylesheets %></code></pre>
  
  into:
  
  <pre><code><%= stylesheet_include_tag 'application' %>
  <%= stylesheet_include_tag 'articles' %>
  <%= stylesheet_include_tag 'articles_edit' %>
  <%= stylesheet_include_tag 'articles/edit' %>
  </code></pre>
  
  if the files exist in the @public/stylesheets@.
  
  I have in the past found this approach really handy when working by myself or on a small team.
  
  The second plugin was "Headliner":http://the.railsi.st/2007/5/3/headliner-dry-up-your-page-titles, which handles the common problem of managing page titles in your views in an elegant way.
  
  Headliner lets define your page title to use in the @<title>@ tag in your view, whilst also outputting it. For example:
  
  <pre><code><h2><%= t "About me" %></h2></code></pre>
  
  Would output both:
  
  <pre><code><h2>About me</h2></code></pre>
  
  as well as setting things up so in your layout file you can output that title like so:
  
  <pre><code><%= title :site => "toolmantim.com" %></code></pre>
  
  which would output, with no extra work:
  
  <pre><code><title>toolmantim.com: About me</title></code></pre>
  
  Big ups to Patrick for giving a talk whilst he's in town and staying til the taps ran dry at the pub. Unfortunately I've no incriminating photos were captured (yet), unlike "previous international super-star RORO guests":http://flickr.com/photos/toolmantim/298325141/.
  
  h3(#hoan-ton-that). Hoan Ton-That - Facebook on Rails
  
  "Hoan":http://www.ton-that.org/ finished up the night with a demonstration of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/facebook-rails">facebook-rails</a> plugin he's written and using to power the "Writeslab":http://apps.facebook.com/writeslab/ facebook application.
  
  I'd previously spoken to Hoan at "Railscamp":http://toolmantim.com/article/2007/7/17/rails_camp_07_rundown about it, but was particularly keen to see a demo and hear more as I'm working on a facebook app myself.
  
  Hoan showed some very Rails-esque facebook integration using his facebook-rails plugin, which builds upon RFacebook code to make the Rails code just damn sexy.
  
  For example, the code to implement getting user details goes from this with RFacebook:
  
  <pre><code class="ruby">xml = fbsession.users_getInfo(:uids => [fbsession.session_user_id], :fields => ["first_name", "last_name"])
  firstName = xml.at("first_name").inner_html
  lastName = xml.at("last_name").inner_html
  </code></pre>
  
  to, when using facebook-rails, something much sexier:
  
  <pre><code class="ruby">u = User.find(fbsession.session_user_id)
  u.first_name
  u.last_name
  </code></pre>
  
  Want to send a notification to the user's friends that they've puked on them? Of course you do.
  
  <pre><code class="ruby">class PukeNotificationPublisher < Facebook::NotificationPublisher
    def puke(friends)
      @to_ids = friends.map(&:uid) # bug in redcloth, should read &:uid
      @text   = "just puked on you"
    end
  end
  </code></pre>
  
  Not to mention @redirect_to@ now works as you'd expect, the urls are mapped all nicely for you and support @url_for@, and lots of other little goodies. Awesome work Hoan!
  
  After the presentation's wrapped up we headed to PJ O'Briens for some bevvies and food.
  
  Two things I forgot to mention on the night though were those who haven't got them should've picked up their "railscamp tees":http://flickr.com/photos/tags/yieldshirt (yeah I know, not real good now) and "Dr Nic":http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/users/10 is running a "Beginner Ruby on Rails Workshop":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/07/09/web-directions-south-workshop/ alongside the "Web Directions conference":http://www.webdirections.org/ on September 25.
  
  To keep up-to-date with the Sydney Rails events check out the "the Rubyholic.com page":http://rubyholic.com/groups/show/63 along with the ical feed subscription that's available from there.
  
  Keep an eye out for some exciting but as-yet-unannounced Rails events coming up in Sydney over the next 3 months, and don't worry... the recordings of last night's presentations should be up early next week.
