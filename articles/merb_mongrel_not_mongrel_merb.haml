  It might have been blazingly obvious to others but I only just got my head around what a production setup of "Merb":http://www.merbivore.com/ involves. After wrecking my head dreaming up custom rackup files to run vendor'd edge Merb I finally realised I was thinkin old-skool.
  
  Your typical Rails stack goes <em>balancer &#8594; mongrel &#8594; Rails</em>.
  
  I naively went upon setting up something similar for a production Merb app: <em>balancer to thin to Merb</em>. This actually works just fine thanks to thin's baked-in support for Merb... but it's not really what you want. You'll also find it hard to use frozen Merb.
  
  Thanks to geniuses that are <a href="http://github.com/ezmobius/">ezra</a> and <a href="http://github.com/wycats/">yehuda</a>, to run merb in production is actually the same as development&mdash;you use <code>merb</code>!
  
  Merb itself hooks up to which ever adapter you want it to speak to the web through... whether it be mongrel, thin, ebb or mycoolnewrackhandler.
  
  so... what you really want to do is: <em>balancer &#8594; Merb &#8594; thin</em>.
  
  A nice Merb deployment recipe that's ticking along for me nicely at the moment:
  
  * "nginx":http://nginx.net/ for vhosting, asset serving and proxying to the merb instances
  * merb booted using "merb-manage":http://github.com/eldiablo/merb-manage/
  * the "thin":http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/ merb adapter
  
  Soon I'll chuck in "haproxy":http://haproxy.1wt.eu/ for load balancing across merb instances.
