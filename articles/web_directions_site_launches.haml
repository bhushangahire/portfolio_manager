  The "Web Directions site":http://wd06.com has just been launched with all the juicy details and online registration.
  
  The registration system was built with Rails and thanks to the kind folk that are WD I'll be releasing a few "extracted":http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/rails_11_loaded_with_37s_extractions.php plugins in the coming weeks: SimpleAuthorisation, AccessibleFormBuilder and "eMatters":http://ematters.com.au support for "ActiveMerchant":http://home.leetsoft.com/am/.
  
  _SimpleAuthorisation_ allows you to add simple, HTTP-based, app-wide password protection for the initial stages of your application's development. Using it is a matter of:
  <pre><code>
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include SimpleAuthorisable
    before_filter :simple_auth_required
  end
  </code></pre>
  
  and setting the username and password in your <code>environment.rb</code>.
  
  _AccessibleFormBuilder_ is a Rails 1.1 form builder that help output input labels which respect a model's validation. It'll allow you to use code such as:
  <pre><code>
  <dl class="horizontal-form billing">
    <dt><%= f.label :name, :required => true %></dt>
    <dd><%= f.text_field :name %></dd>
    <dt><%= f.label :company %></dt>
    <dd><%= f.text_field :company %></dd>
    <dt><%= f.label :email, :required => true %></dt>
    <dd><%= f.text_field :email %></dd>
    <dt class="last">
      <%= f.label :phone_number,
                  :required => true,
                  :value => "Ph. number" %>
    </dt>
    <dd class="last"><%= f.text_field :phone_number %></dd>
  </dl>
  </code></pre>
  
  It also ships with a few view helpers: <code>accessible_form_for</code> and <code>accessible_fields_for</code>.
  
  If you haven't already done so, go grab your ticket for WD06. If you're involved with web development you'd be crazy to miss this year's "killer lineup":http://www.webdirections.org/whos-speaking/.
