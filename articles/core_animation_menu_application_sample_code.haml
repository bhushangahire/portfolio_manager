  It seems Apple's "Core Animation Menu Application":http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Articles/Headstart.html example app doesn't come with a source code package and is littered with typos. I've fixed the typos and packaged it up here for people wanting to test it out and have a play.
  
  Check out "the result":http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Articles/art/anim_menuscreenshot.mp4 from setting up a few layers and animations in Cocoa with Quartz and Core Animation.
