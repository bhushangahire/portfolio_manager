  Finally "admitting his licking obsession":http://themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2007/03/05/, Cam published a blog post on thousands of unsuspecting Javascript kiddies, the effect of which has seen a huge surge in "timwouldlickit.com submissions":http://timwouldlickit.com/gallery/ over the past few days. Andrew even managed to add comments in there too.
  
  My favourites so far, in no particular order:

  It's great to be a talking point at international web events; not for something insightful I've said, or for something innovative I've made; but for my tongue.
  
  I'm guessing this will hit the press more seriously whilst the gang, sans me, is over at SXSW (the bastards). Am keenly waiting to see what happens.
