  It seems that with the recent change in temperature we've seen a great influx in the offline activity in the web design community in Australia. Cameron "seems to have noticed it":http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2006/11/08/ too.
  
  Unfortunately the un-offline (see: online) community (see: blogging) still seems like a fraction of the size of our American and Pommy brethen's, but I'm digging this spate of real-life meetups.
  
  So why so many flesh-meets now? My guess is that either:
  
  # Everybody's in the mood for organised piss-ups.
  # The web dev community has reached as critical mass where people see enough interest to run these events.
  
  The following four events are on my radar as must-attends.
