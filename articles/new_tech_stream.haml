  Well against Maxine's "sage advice":http://toolmantim.com/article/2006/2/8/tech_or_personal#comment-55 I've created another stream on toolmantim.com for all my tech related stuff.
  
  I'll mostly be covering web development (rails, coldfusion, web standards) and other fun, nerd related topics.
  
  We'll see how thing go, and I might end up just spinning this off onto a separate blog... but for now its just a bit of a fun experiment I guess.
