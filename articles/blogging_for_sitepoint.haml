  I've just jumped on board with the Melbourne-based "Sitepoint":http://www.sitepoint.com to post on their "Rails blog":http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/category/ruby-on-rails/, which was "in need of some love":http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/05/05/using-plugins-in-your-app/#comment-23848.
  
  Any Rails related stuff will be posted over there rather than here (except, of course, for any overly blantant self-promotion), as they've already a large and interested readership.
