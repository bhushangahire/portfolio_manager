  After seeing a demo of <a href="http://www.fluxiom.com/">Fluxiom</a>'s user permission system in January 2006 I set out to recreate the effect. A few months ago I stumbled upon the code and screencapped what I'd done. I think it looks pretty neat.
  
  It's your stock-standard ActiveRecord based model with backend validation and saving to the DB with ajaxy zoopy goodness--Rails 0.14.3.
  
  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/1706787d/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/1706787d/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" name="viddler" ></embed></object>
