  "Justin French":http://justinfrench.com/, one of our Aussie railers from way back, has been secretly codin away at an upcoming Aussie startup "RedBubble":http://redbubble.com.au/, who've finally sent an update to their email subscribers. I've always seen Justin French as a bit of a designer-cum-programmer, or "web technologist" "as Cameron Adams puts it":http://www.themaninblue.com/about/, so a position as senior developer at RedBubble in Melbourne sounds like a spot-on position.
  
  The idea behind RedBubble is an online community and marketplace for artists to share, comment, display and sell their creative work. From the sneak peek they sent through it looks like there's a heavy focus on printed media&#8212;no sign of interactive media exhibiting and selling DVDs for example&#8212;though maybe other media types are slated for the future.

  They've even put together "a cute introduction video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7PCaZdV-P8 and posted it to the viral marketing tool of choice: YouTube. How refreshing it is to hear an Australian accent!
  
  Can't wait to see how RedBubble goes. It's based in Melbourne, the creative heart of Australia, so I'm sure they'll have a loyal following from Day 1.
