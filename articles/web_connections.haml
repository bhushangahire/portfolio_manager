  "Cam":http://themaninblue.com and I have released "Web Connections":http://connections.webdirections.org upon the world, a site for the delegates of the upcoming "Web Directions 2006 conference":http://webdirections.org to meet one another, play with maps and all that kinda thing.
  
  ...and it's only really just occured to me that the conference is next week! As in, _next_ week. It's gonna be great seeing some faces I haven't seen for ages, and there's a killer speaker line up.
  
  There's still a few tickets left too if you haven't got yours yet.
